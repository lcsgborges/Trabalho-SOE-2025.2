    The expectative is that this is able to output 
    a single clean .csv from the file provided.

    This will be hardcoded for simplicity's sake.
    Since most probably you'd need to do this 
    differently for every dataset, there's 
    no actual advantage to try to make this 
    general. Pandas is already general enough.

    Anyway, given a good dataset, we need to extract
    temperature, humidity
